# Competitive Programming

Personal repository where I save all my competitive programming codes, created after [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) participation in 2019.

__Notebook__: Implementation and adaptation of algorithms that I use in competitions. They are automatically compiled in `Notebook.pdf` to be printed for competitions.

__Solutions__: Solutions to problems of various online judges (online systems to test programs in programming contests).

__Contests__: Code of problems solved in programming competitions.
