Personal repository where I save all my competitive programming codes, created after [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) participation in 2019.

__Notebook__: Implementation and adaptation of algorithms that I use in competitions.

__Solutions__: Solutions to problems of various online judges (online systems to test programs in programming contests).

__Contests__: Code of problems solved in competitive programming competitions.
